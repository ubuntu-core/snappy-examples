# Hello world!

This is a snappy demo package that shows how to build and package a minimalistic webserver
in golang for snappy. This package is multi-architecture enabled.

To build for both amd64 and armhf, on an amd64 host, create the binaries in the architecture
dependent directories. the magic-bin/go-example-webserver launch script will do the magic
to find the right architecture and launch the right binary.

To build simply do this:

 snapcraft

This produces a snappy package for you that you can try on your snappy system.

Have fun!
